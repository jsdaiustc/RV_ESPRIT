function [ x ] = generalized_structured_shrinkage( y, T, Neigh_Size, Method)
% This function calculate the generalized structured shrinkage
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Input %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% y:                          The input signal
% T:                          The K-sparsity threshold
% Neigh_Size:                 The size of the window
% Params: a struct contains all the parameters
%       Params.W_type:        The weight type: 'SESK', 'multi-scale PMI' or 'None'
%                             SESK: square envelope spectrum kurtosis (default)
%                             multi-scale PMI: multi-scale periodic modulation intensity
%                             None: the weight is inoperative
%       Params.Fs:            The sampling frequency of the simulation signal
%       Params.F_Interval:    The searching interval of the characteristic frequency
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Output %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Weight:                     The generated weight vector
